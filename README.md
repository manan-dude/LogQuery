# Log Management System

This project implements a Log Management System consisting of a log ingestor that captures logs from multiple APIs and stores them into designated log files, and a Query Interface that allows users to search and filter through these logs efficiently.

## Project Overview

The Log Management System comprises two main components:

1. **Log Ingestor (Backend)**
   - Integrates with 8-9 APIs to capture logs at different stages.
   - Standardizes log format and writes logs to designated log files `logs/access.log`.
   - Provides configurable logging levels and file paths.
   - Implements robust error handling to ensure logging reliability.

2. **Query Interface (Frontend)**
   - Offers a user-friendly interface (web-based) for searching and filtering logs.
   - Supports full-text search and various filters (level, time range , regex...).
   - Provides efficient search results and scalability.

## System Architecture

The system architecture involves a backend server `(Node.js)` for the Log Ingestor and a frontend interface `(React)` for the Query Interface. The backend utilizes Express for API handling, `Morgan` for logging, and `Axios` for making HTTP requests. The frontend communicates with the backend via Axios for fetching logs and applying filters.

## Features

- **API Integration**
  - Captures logs from diverse sources using 8-9 APIs.
  - Standardizes log format (`JSON`) for consistency.

- **Logging Configuration**
  - Allows configurable logging levels (`info`, `success`, `error`) and file paths.

- **Error Handling**
  - Implements robust error handling to prevent disruptions in logging.

- **Query Interface**
  - Provides a web-based user interface for log searching and filtering.
  - Supports filters based on (level, time range , regex...).
  - Enables efficient and quick search results.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.
- Git for version control (optional).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/manan-dude/LogQuery.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd LoggingSystem
   ```

3. Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install

   cd ../
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

- Configure logging levels and file paths in the backend (`./backend/index.js`).
- Update API URLs and logging configurations based on project requirements.

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend server (Log Ingestor):
   ```bash
   node Backend.js
   ```


2. Start the frontend server (Query Interface):
   
   ```bash
   cd frontend/api-tester
   npm start
   ```


4. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. **API Tester**
   - Click on "API Test" to initiate requests to predefined APIs.
   - *Test All APIs as their logs will be kept in logs folder , Basically if we implemented any other API for any application we can change instead of this APIs.*
   - View logs generated by API requests in real-time.


2. **Log Query**
   - Click on "Log Query" to access the Query Interface.
   - Use filters to search and narrow down logs based on various criteria (level, timestamp, etc.).
   - View filtered logs with relevant details.



## Advanced Features

- **Date Range Filtering** (Bonus)
  - Implement search within specific date ranges for more refined queries.
  
- **Regular Expression Search** (Bonus)
  - Allow users to use regular expressions for more complex log searches.

- **Real-time Log Ingestion and Search** (Bonus)
  - Implement real-time updates for log ingestion and searching capabilities.
